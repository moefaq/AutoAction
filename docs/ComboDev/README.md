# Development of Rotation.

Thank you for join the circle of rotation developers who have a role called `xxx dev` in [Discord](https://discord.gg/4fECHunam9). 

Actually, all the rotations should be developed by the players who  who have a certain understanding of the job, not me who doesn't.  I would like you to share your own rotation to the public!

I'll make it easier and easier to develop a custom rotation.

## Responsibility

- Basic
  - Maintain your own rotation.
  - Answer the questions about your own rotation.
- Advanced
  - Maintain the action list.
  - Maintain the id of action or status.
