# Rotation Information

So we need to fill the blank in the methods mentioned [before](RotationDev/rotation.md). But what data do we need to organize the [logic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/boolean-logical-operators) with? First of all, there is the information in rotation.
